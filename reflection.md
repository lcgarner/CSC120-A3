Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I consulted with Liberty Lehr and Nathalie Trouba on this assignment. 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I attended Dakota's session on Sunday 7-9pm. They really helped me review ArrayLists and figure out the general direction of my program. 
- What are your initial impressions of Java?
    I have programmed in Java before this class, but in returning to Java, I have remembered just how many more syntax requirements there seem to be. It probably seems this way to me in part because Java is a compile language and will constantly remind me about errors (and possible errors) before I can even run the program. I do actually like this feature because it forces me to stay on top of the possible errors in my program before I build on top of them and they multiply. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    The basic logic of both is the same, and most of what I learned in Python is easily transferrable to Java. I find that Java has more capabilities; this tells me that when programming and starting projects I should be very careful about which language I use, as different languages have different benefits/strengths, but that the logic of a program will never change even if it is expressed in another language. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Splitting the user's response into words really helped me. Something that did not work was including the first phrase of the conversation in the for loop. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to draw out diagrams on paper to figure out the structure of their code, especially for assignments like this where everything is just in main. This technique helped me keep everything organized.
